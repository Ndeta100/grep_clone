I'm nobody!, Who are you
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us -don't tell!
They'll banish us

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!

 
Are you nobody, too?
 
How dreary to be somebody!
 
To tell your name the livelong day
 
To an admiring bog!
